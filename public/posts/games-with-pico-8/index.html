This weekend, I decided to try something different - programming a game in some esoteric environment. Since I don&rsquo;t have a Commodore 64, I went with the PICO-8, and man did I have fun.
It reminded me a lot of programming in BASIC back in the day, typing in games from magazines and books.
Overview of features

Built-in sprite and SFX editors
Built-in editor for full retro experience
Can edit files outside of the VM as well

Pros
I really liked at first the idea of programming inside the machine itself, but that quickly got tedious for me. Fortunately, the .p8 file is just a text file. The code language is a subset of Lua. I&rsquo;d never coded in Lua before, but it&rsquo;s a fun little scripting language.">

<p>This weekend, I decided to try something different - programming a game in some esoteric environment. Since I don&rsquo;t have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>, I went with the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>, and man did I have fun.</p>
<p>It reminded me a lot of programming in BASIC back in the day, typing in games from magazines and books.</p>

<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<p>I really liked at first the idea of programming inside the machine itself, but that quickly got tedious for me. Fortunately, the .p8 file is just a text file. The code language is a subset of <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>. I&rsquo;d never coded in Lua before, but it&rsquo;s a fun little scripting language.</p>
<p>The built-in sprite editor is really nice. Has all the basic things you&rsquo;d want in a sprite editor, the ability to change the size of the sprites, etc. You can even export the sprites to a PNG!</p>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<p>I felt like learning the system with just the basic docs was quite difficult. I ended up getting a book, <a href="https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-PICO-8-issue1"><em>Game Development with PICO-8</em></a> that really helped. I also bookmarked the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico8_manual.txt">system manual</a> which has good API docs in it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also no debugging method other than <code>print()</code>, so if you rely on debugging in an IDE or at the command line, tough. Most BASIC interpreters back in the day didn&rsquo;t either, so no big loss there.</p>
<h2 id="ok-so-wheres-the-game">Ok, so where&rsquo;s the game?</h2>
<p>I built a blackjack game! It&rsquo;s super simple, aces are always 1, there&rsquo;s no splitting, no insurance, nothing like that. It was really fun to build.</p>
<p>However, occasionally when starting/restarting the game, we get a nil reference to either one of the player&rsquo;s cards or one of the dealer&rsquo;s cards. Not sure what&rsquo;s going on there, but I suspect I&rsquo;m not doing some initialization correctly.</p>

<li><a href="/blackjack.p8.png">PNG</a> (Yes, you can export it as a PNG, and import that PNG into PICO-8!)</li>
