This is a series of posts about encryption for .NET developers.

## In this series

* [Intro (this post)]({{< ref "encryption-intro.md" >}})

## Why?

I've been a developer across many languages and platforms for almost 20 years. Encryption is one of those topics that always seemed to elude me. So, in a journey of my own learning, I want to bring you along for the ride. 

## What we will cover

* Asymmetric encryption
* Symmetric encryption
* Encryption patterns and usage in .NET
* When and why to use certain patterns and algorithms

## What this series is not

This series should *not* be seen as a comprehensive or academic study of encryption.
